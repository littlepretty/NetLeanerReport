\subsection{Unsupervised Generative Models}
The amount of network traffic data is enormously large, usually in the order of terabytes
per day in a large monitored network.
Such available big data makes deep learning techniques a promisingly better solution
to traffic classification.
In practice, however, the amount of data is impossible for a human security analyst or
a group of them to review, e.g., to find patterns and label anomalies.
Generative model which can be trained unsupervised comes to rescue in that
\begin{itemize}
    \item It utilizes the large amount of unlabeled data to learning useful and hierarchical features
        from the data itself;
    \item It is equivalently a way to initialize the weights of the hidden layers
        in a deep neural network, which can be further fine-tuned to be a high performance classifier.
\end{itemize}
In this project we propose to try two generative models: restricted Boltzmann machine and autoencoders.
