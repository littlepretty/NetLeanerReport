\section{Conclusion}
In this project we conducted a comparative study on the deep learning approaches
for the network intrusion detection problem.
We take the off-line network intrusion detection dataset NSL-KDD for evaluation.
In this paper, multilayer perceptron, restricted Boltzmann machine, sparse autoencoder
and denoising autoencoder are briefly described.
The main contribution lies on sharing the hacks and tricks used in training these neural networks
and the results of comparable evaluation of them.
From our experiment results, we conclude that for the NSL-KDD test dataset,
multilayer perceptron has relatively best performance since both its accuracy and F1-Score
are outstanding among compared neural networks.
